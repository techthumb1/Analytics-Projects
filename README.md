# Analytics-Projects

This repository will serve as a collection of projects that I have worked on, are working on, or will in th future. The projects will be in the form of Jupyter Notebooks, and will be organized by topic. The topics will be as follows:

We will begin a project that is a collection of several projects via notebooks or python scripts. The projects will be supported by a real-world demonstration in a medium article.

The type of projects that we will be covering are:
Deep Learning Recommendation System
Predicting Brent Oil Prices
Newspaper Headline Classification Using PySpark
Deployment In Production
Sentiment Analysis using NLP
Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data
Image Classification using CNN

Just to name a few. We plan to use various libraries and frameworks such as TensorFlow, Keras, and PySpark to build and implement these projects. Each project will be explained in detail with accompanying code and explanations, and the real-world demonstration will provide a practical application of the concepts and techniques used in the projects.

The Deep Learning Recommendation System will use neural networks to analyze user behavior and preferences to make personalized recommendations. The Brent Oil Price Prediction project will utilize time series analysis and machine learning to predict future oil prices. The Newspaper Headline Classification project will use PySpark to classify headlines into different categories. The Deployment in Production project will focus on deploying these models in a real-world setting and will discuss various strategies for scaling and optimizing performance. Sentiment Analysis project will use libraries such as NLTK and scikit-learn to analyze text data and determine the sentiment of the text, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral. The Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data project will use techniques such as clustering and statistical analysis to identify patterns and anomalies in time series data. Finally, the Image Classification project will use CNNs to classify images into different categories.

Overall, the goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive guide to building and implementing various machine learning and deep learning projects, and to demonstrate their practical applications in the real world.
