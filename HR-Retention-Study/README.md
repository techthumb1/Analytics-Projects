# Human Resource Retention Study

## Introduction

This project is a Human Resource Retention Study that aims to understand the factors that contribute to employee turnover. The goal is to use machine learning techniques and statistical analysis to model and predict employee turnover.

## Data

The data used in this project was collected from a Human Resource department and includes employee characteristics, job satisfaction, and other relevant factors. The data has been preprocessed to handle any missing values or outliers.

## Methods

The project uses various machine learning techniques such as regression and classification to model the data and make predictions about employee turnover. We have used libraries such as scikit-learn and statsmodels to implement these techniques.

## Results

The performance of the models was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. The results of the study showed that certain factors such as job satisfaction and work-life balance are important predictors of employee turnover.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive guide to building and implementing a Human Resource Retention Study using machine learning techniques. The results of the study can be used by Human Resource departments to improve employee retention and reduce turnover.
